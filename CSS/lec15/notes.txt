The <span> tag is an inline element by default, meaning it doesn’t respect height and 
width properties like block-level elements (e.g., <div>, <p>) do. Inline elements only take up as
 much space as their content requires, and they don’t create new blocks of space on the page.

To make the height and width properties work on a <span>, you need to change its display property to 
something that respects these dimensions. For example, you can use:

span {
  display: inline-block;
  height: 50px;
  width: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

inline-block: Allows the <span> to behave like an 
inline element but also respect height and width.
block: Forces the <span> to behave like a block-level element, taking up full width 
and allowing height to be applied.
